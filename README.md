# employee_login_logout
This project is for employee login - logout system TRACKING EMPLOYEE LOGIN-LOGOUT An IT specialist working in a medium-sized company, and manager wants to create a daily report that tracks the use of machines. Specifically, he/she wants to know which users are currently connected to which machines, it's his/her job to create the report. In company, there's a system that collects every event that happens on the machines on the network. Among the many events collected it records each time a user logs in or out of a computer. With this information, a Python Script is written that generates a report of which users are logged in to which machines at that time. The event types are strings and the ones we care about are login and logout. The script will receive a list of event objects and will access the events attributes. We'll then use that information to know if a user is currently logged into a machine or not. We want to generate a report that lists all the machine names and for each machine, lists of the users that are currently logged in. We then want this information printed on the screen.
